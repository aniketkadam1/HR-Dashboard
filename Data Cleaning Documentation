### Data Cleaning Steps

1. Removed non-informative columns (EmployeeCount, Over18, StandardHours)
2. Verified and corrected data types
3. Trimmed and cleaned text columns
4. Created new analytical fields:
   - Attrition Flag (Yes/No → 1/0)
   - Salary Band (Low / Medium / High)
   - Experience Band (Fresher / Junior / Mid / Senior)
   - Overtime Flag
5. Validated row count and key metrics after cleaning
